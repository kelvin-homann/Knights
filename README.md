Knights is a Real Time Strategy game developed for Unity3D. It is supposed to be very casual and is played with controllers. It was devoped for our Game Development class. 

- 	When you open the Unity project for the first time you should make sure your project contains
	the default folder structure. To add any missing folders open Unity and click on
		Tools->Create Folder Structure
	this will create any missing folders for your project.

-	Place any files/tools/plugins related to your personal Unity workflow,
	or any other files that should not be covered by version control inside
	the Assets/User
